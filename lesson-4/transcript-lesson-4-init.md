Ok. One last command and it is the Git command that is used to get a repository started. However, when working on existing projects or with other developers, you are not likely to use it very often.

To create a new repository using SourceTree, go to the "Repository Browser" screen, click "New Repository" and choose "Create local repository". Then complete the information for where you want it to be and what you want to call it. You also have the option to create the remote repository on GitHub.com at the same time. Click "Create".
