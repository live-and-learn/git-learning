Now let's talk about pull requests. For these lessons, you have been making changes to the fork you created from the sample repository for this course. If you wanted to request that the revisions you made to your fork get pulled into the original repository, you can create a pull request.

Pull requests are not just for when you don't have write access to a repository. For example, you could be working on files in a repository along with other people and all of you have write access to the repository. However, you want to commit some changes, but you want someone else to review them and no one is available at the moment. You can create a branch with your changes, commit your changes to that branch, and push branch with the changes to GitHub.com. Then create a pull request.

Go ahead and create a pull request for the original sample course repository with the revisions you have in your fork. To do this, choose "Create Pull Request" from the "Repository" menu.

Make sure your options look like this and click “Create Pull Request On Web”.


You will be directed to an "Open a pull request" page on GitHub.com. Type a title for the request, a short description if you want to, and click "Create pull request". The owners of the original repository will be notified of the request. Don't worry that the request will cause any problems. Someone with write access to the original repository would have to merge the pull request to add your changes to the original repository.
