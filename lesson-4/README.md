#Lesson 4
To get started in lesson 4, first create a fork of the GitHub.com repository that these lessons are in.
[Video showing how to create a fork](http://youtu.be/haS1_gxGx0U "Video about creating a fork of a GitHub.com repository") of this repository (https://github.com/live-and-learn/git-learning.git).

In lesson 2 you learned the basic Git commands. In fact, you learned enough Git commands to get by with the usual work you might need to do on a Git repository. Perhaps you like doing most of your work with a command line. That's certainly ok. However, there are several graphical interface apps with which you can manage Git repositories. Some benefits of graphical interface apps are: easier management of multiple repositories, graphical comparison of file differences, and no need to remember the Git command parameters.

SourceTree is just one of several apps that you can use. It is free and does a good job managing multiple repositories. GitHub.com also has an app specifically for GitHub.com and it is free.

If you have decided to use a graphical interface Git application other than SourceTree, you may still be able to watch the following video and find the Git functions in the app you have chosen.
