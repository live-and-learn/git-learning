Before actually using SourceTree. Let's talk about some similarities and difference between using Git at the command line and using an app like SourceTree. When you use SourceTree it is issuing the Git commands for you. Buttons are usually labelled with the name of the Git command they perform.

Both Git commands and SourceTree can act on the same repository (you can manipulate the same repository with Git commands and SourceTree). SourceTree does not make its own version of the Git repository. You may want to perform Git commands from the command line or from SourceTree depending on which is more convenient at the moment. You can do that.

Some differences are that SourceTree has a visual interface that may make some operations easier, however, Git commands may be faster to do because no mouse movement is required.

Ok. Let's start using SourceTree. Download SourceTree from http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/ and install it.

SourceTree has two screens that you will use the most. The repository browser screen lists any repositories that you have told SourceTree about. You can show this screen by pressing Cmd + B (Mac) or selecting "Show Repository Browser" from the Window menu.
The other screen is the repository screen which is the screen you will use to manage a repository.
