Welcome to code version control using Git, GitHub.com, and SourceTree.

This course is designed to quickly get you started using Git and GitHub.com whether you have decided on your own to use Git or you are required to use it for your career and no matter your experience with code versioning or prior use of Git.

The course is very basic to start with and is organized in small sections. Feel free to skip any sections you don't think you'll need. The course instruction should take about an hour. Feel free to take more time to practice if you would like.

The instruction on Git will prepare you to use Git in any environment. The instruction about GitHub.com is specific that code hosting platform and does not apply to other hosting platforms. This course uses SourceTree as a graphical interface for using Git and managing code repositories because that is what the course designers use and SourceTree is free (probably why the course designers use it). If you have decided to use a different graphical Git app, you may skip the section on SourceTree or try to follow that section using the app that you have chosen.

The lessons in this course are actually in this Git repository (a place where code lives). You will be reading and watching the instruction from that repository and completing tasks using it. Don't worry about breaking it for others. You'll understand soon enough that this is not possible.

While this course refers to source code versioning, any computer file can live in Git and GitHub.com. This means that you don’t have to be a programmer to learn Git and use GitHub.com. You can actually put text documents, images, and presentation documents in Git and GitHub.com.

Ok. That should be enough to get started so, [click here to start the first lesson](https://github.com/live-and-learn/git-learning/tree/master/lesson-1 "Lesson 1 about version control and an introduction to Git.").
